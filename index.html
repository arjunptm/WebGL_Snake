                Single Player Mode

                The player controles the

                snake. Let's call him Snakey. Use the arrow keys to control Snakey.
            </p>
            <p>
                You must eat the
                <font color="blue">
                    blue
                </font>
                food particle that will appear at random locations, while avoiding the walls, Snakey's own body and the

                    grey

                snake. (Let's call her Miss Hiss).
            </p>
            <p>
                You have 2 powers to use:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use the spacebar to toggle between high speed and low speed. You will get 2x points for every food eaten in the high speed mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use M to activate
                        <b>
                            GOD MODE
                        </b>
                        . While in God mode, you will be indestructible for about 0.7 seconds. If you time it right, you can use it to escape tough situations.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Press I to toggle between over-the-shoulder view and the normal view. You get double points for this as well. Multipliers stack, so over-the-shoulder high speed mode will give you 4x points.

                    Two Player Mode
                </h4>
                <p>
                    To start a two player mode, all you need to do is start controlling Miss Hiss with the W, A, S and D keys to move. This will change the Non Playable Snake to a player controlled snake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Player one still controls Snakey with the same keys as before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same rules apply to each player: No hitting walls, yourself or the other snake. The player who hits any of these loses. In case of a tie due to head-on collision, the player with the higher score wins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Power-up instructions:

                            High speed mode is disabled in the two player mode to avoid the players from fighting each other in the real world.
